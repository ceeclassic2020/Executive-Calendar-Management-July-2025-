# Executive Calendar Management (July 2025)

## Creating and managing a full monthly calendar 

### Project Overview

This project was part of my hands-on training as a Virtual Assistant. I was tasked with creating and managing a full monthly calendar for a client (simulated boss), handling scheduling logistics, meetings, tasks, and availability with accuracy and professionalism.

### Objectives

- Create a detailed calendar for July 2025  
- Schedule meetings, webinars, content sessions, and check-ins  
- Manage and resolve scheduling conflicts  
- Block out vacation days and break periods  
- Maintain a clean, organized view for easy weekly access

### Methodology

🧭 Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Understanding the Request

I started by carefully reading the client’s email to understand their priorities and preferences:
	•	Weekly structure by task type (Admin, Calls, Content, Light Work)
	•	Specific dates for travel, a webinar, content shoot, and review
	•	Preferences for call limits, break times, and buffer before meetings
	•	Color coding scheme for task categories

#### 2. Setting Up the Weekly Template

Using Google Calendar, I blocked out recurring weekly time slots:
	•	🟡 Mondays for Admin tasks (full day)
	•	🔵 Tuesdays & Thursdays for client calls (10 AM – 3 PM, max 3 per day, each with 15 min prep time)
	•	🟢 Wednesdays reserved fully for Content Creation (no calls allowed)
	•	🟡 Fridays for light work with an 🔵 11 AM Team Check-in

I used the “Repeat Weekly” feature to apply these consistently across July.

#### 3. Blocking Out Important Dates

Next, I added the one-time events and travel as specified:
	•	🔴 Vacation: July 13–18 (Marked as “Busy”)
	•	🔵 Webinar: July 6 at 7 PM (with 15 min prep added before)
	•	🟢 Content Shoot: July 24 at 10 AM
	•	🟡 Monthly Review: July 31 at 4 PM

#### 4. Adding Daily Breaks

To ensure balance, I inserted a 30-minute break at 1 PM daily (set to repeat Monday–Friday). These were marked as “Free” to avoid conflicts but served as a reminder.

#### 5. Color Coding

Each event was tagged with a color for easy identification:
	•	🟡 Yellow for Admin Tasks
	•	🔵 Blue for Client Calls/Meetings
	•	🟢 Green for Content Creation/Shoots
	•	🔴 Red for Travel or Vacation

This makes it visually easy to spot types of tasks at a glance.

#### 6. Final Touches
-   Verified time zone (GMT+1 as requested)
-   Reviewed calendar to ensure no overlaps
- 	Took a screenshot of the final calendar setup
-   Sent it to the client for confirmation

###  Tasks Executed

- Created events with clear titles, descriptions & locations  
-  Set up recurring tasks (weekly team meetings, check-ins)  
 - Adjusted for client unavailability on certain days  
 - Rescheduled overlapping events  
 - Inserted half-day and vacation breaks from July 13th–18th  
- Color-coded categories for visual clarity  
- Time-zoned all entries for remote coordination  

### Key result

- Client availability respected and optimized  
- A full month of structured workflow established  
- Clear communication through event titles and notes
