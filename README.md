## Creating and managing a full monthly calendar 

## Project Overview

To help a client plan and manage their busy July 2025 calendar in a way that promotes productivity without overwhelm. The goal was to:

Structure their weekly tasks clearly

Block time for travel, events, and key appointments

Color-code entries for easy readability

Include prep and break time for work-life balance


## Objectives

- Create a detailed calendar for July 2025  
- Schedule meetings, webinars, content sessions, and check-ins  
- Manage and resolve scheduling conflicts  
- Block out vacation days and break periods  
- Maintain a clean, organized view for easy weekly access

##  Calendar Setup (July 2025)

 üóìÔ∏è General Weekly Structure I‚Äôd Like:
		‚Ä¢	Monday: Admin day (emails, planning, finances)
	‚Ä¢	Tuesday & Thursday: Client calls between 10 AM ‚Äì 3 PM (max 3 per day)
	‚Ä¢	Wednesday: Content creation day (no calls)
	‚Ä¢	Friday: Light work, team check-in at 11 AM

	Important Dates:
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm traveling to Cape Town: July 13th‚Äì18th (block this as ‚ÄúVacation‚Äù)
	‚Ä¢	Webinar: July 6th at 7 PM GMT+1
	‚Ä¢	Content shoot: July 24th at 10 AM
	‚Ä¢	Monthly review: July 31st at 4 PM

	Other Notes:
		‚Ä¢	Please color-code tasks by type:
üü° Admin | üîµ Calls | üü¢ Content | üî¥ Travel
	‚Ä¢	Add 15 min prep time before all calls.
	‚Ä¢	Add 30 min breaks every day by 1 PM.



##   Features & Highlights

I started by carefully reading the client‚Äôs email to understand their priorities and preferences:
	‚Ä¢	Weekly structure by task type (Admin, Calls, Content, Light Work)
	‚Ä¢	Specific dates for travel, a webinar, content shoot, and review
	‚Ä¢	Preferences for call limits, break times, and buffer before meetings
	‚Ä¢	Color coding scheme for task categorie

##  Tools Used
